# Welcome to my profile!

- My name is Maxim, I am 29 years old, I am a novice specialist in the field of data analysis and data science.

- While studying at the university, I got acquainted with programming to solve the problem of optimizing the technological process. After that, I became interested in this area and learned about data analysis and machine learning. From the relevant work experience at the moment, there is experience only in training projects where data analysis methods were used, working with libraries for data analysis and visualization, sampling metrics, building and choosing the best model.
- I am familiar with classical machine learning algorithms, as well as more complex algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM.
- I am interested in time series, as well as machine learning applicable in industry.
- I am actively looking for a job and want to develop further in this field, so I am open to various offers in the field of data science.
